# ARCHITECTURE.md — esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons (fork)

> For AI assistant rules and coding conventions, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). For end-user setup, see [README.md](README.md).

## What This Is

A **modular component library** for [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) + [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) that lets you build touchscreen smart home control panels on cheap ESP32 displays. Components are composed via ESPHome's YAML package system — users pick a hardware file, add UI components, and deploy to a device connected to Home Assistant.

This is **not** a Python or JavaScript project. Everything is ESPHome YAML with occasional inline C++ lambdas.

## Core Concepts

### The Package / Include System

The entire library is built on ESPHome's `packages:` and `!include` mechanism. A user's main YAML composes a complete device by including packages:

```yaml
packages:
  hardware: !include esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/hardware/guition-esp32-s3-4848s040.yaml
  colors:   !include esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/common/color.yaml
  fonts:    !include esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/common/fonts.yaml
  glyphs:   !include esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/common/mdi_glyph_substitutions.yaml
  theme:    !include esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/common/theme_style.yaml
  wifi:     !include esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/common/wifi.yaml

  kitchen_light: !include
    file: esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/ui/light/remote.yaml
    vars:
      uid: kitchen_light
      entity_id: "light.kitchen"
      row: 0
      column: 0
      text: Kitchen
      icon: $mdi_ceiling_light
```

One `!include` per entity. All internal wiring (globals, scripts, detail page) is handled inside the component files.

### The `uid` System

Every button instance requires a unique `uid`. It is used as a prefix to generate all LVGL widget IDs, globals, and script names through string interpolation:

```
button_${uid}       — the LVGL button widget
icon_${uid}         — the icon label
label_${uid}        — the text label
slider_${uid}       — inline control (where applicable)
${uid}_is_on        — global tracking on/off state
${uid}_light_toggle — abstract action script
```

**Never reuse a `uid`** across button instances — it causes LVGL ID conflicts and compilation errors.

### Page Extension with `!extend`

Buttons don't create their own pages. They extend an existing page:

```yaml
lvgl:
  pages:
    - id: !extend ${page_id | default("main_page")}
      widgets:
        - container:
            grid_cell_row_pos: ${row}
            grid_cell_column_pos: ${column}
```

The main YAML must define the base page first. Button packages append their widgets to it.

### Grid Layout

Pages use LVGL's grid layout. The shorthand `layout: 3x3` creates a 3-column × 3-row grid. Buttons are placed with `grid_cell_row_pos`, `grid_cell_column_pos`, and optional span properties. All sizing within tiles uses LVGL alignment and percentage-based dimensions — never hardcoded pixel coordinates — so components work across all supported display sizes.

---

## The Component Architecture (New System)

This fork replaces the upstream flat button files with a structured, scalable system. Each entity type lives entirely within its own subfolder under `ui/`. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full contract and coding rules.

### Structure Per Entity Type

```
ui/<type>/local.yaml     — tile widget for a locally-defined ESPHome entity
ui/<type>/remote.yaml    — tile widget for a Home Assistant entity
ui/<type>/detail.yaml    — full-screen detail UI (complex types only)
```

All three files for a type live together. `local.yaml` and `remote.yaml` are the public entry points — users `!include` only these. `detail.yaml` is an internal dependency pulled in via `packages:` inside the button files; it is never included directly by users.

### Local vs Remote

The `local` and `remote` variants share the same tile layout, globals, and detail page. They differ only in how they communicate with the entity:

- **local** — ESPHome native actions and `on_state` hooks
- **remote** — `homeassistant.action` calls and `homeassistant` platform sensors

This is enforced via the **abstract script contract**: each button file implements a fixed set of `${uid}_`-prefixed scripts that the detail page calls without knowing which transport is in use.

### Simple vs Complex Types

- **Simple** (switch, button) — tile only, no detail page. Short-click performs the action.
- **Complex** (light, climate, sensor) — tile plus a full-screen detail page opened via long-press. `detail.yaml` is included by both `local.yaml` and `remote.yaml` via `packages:`.

### Entity Type Status

| Type | Local | Remote | Detail Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| `light` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `switch` | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `sensor` | ✅ | ✅ | — (maybe later) |
| `binary_sensor` | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `text_sensor` | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `button` | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `climate` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Legacy Button Components

The upstream flat button files are present in the repository with a `_legacy` suffix and are considered **superseded**. New devices should use the `ui/` components. These files are not maintained as part of this fork.

| Legacy file | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `buttons/switch_button_legacy.yaml` | `ui/switch/local.yaml` or `ui/switch/remote.yaml` |
| `buttons/sensor_button_legacy.yaml` | `ui/sensor/local.yaml` or `ui/sensor/remote.yaml` |
| `buttons/dimmer_light_button.yaml` + `pages/light_color.yaml` | `ui/light/local.yaml` or `ui/light/remote.yaml` (single include) |
| `buttons/cover_button_legacy.yaml` | — (not planned) |
| `buttons/scene_button_legacy.yaml` | — (not planned) |
| `buttons/page_button_legacy.yaml` | — (not planned) |
| `buttons/time_button_legacy.yaml` | — (not planned) |

## Infrastructure (Unchanged from Upstream)

These modules are reused as-is and not modified by this fork.

### Common (`common/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `color.yaml` | ~50 named colors + full CSS color table reference |
| `fonts.yaml` | Nunito font at 9 sizes (`nunito_12` → `nunito_72`) |
| `mdi_glyph_substitutions.yaml` | 6000+ MDI icon substitutions (`$mdi_lightbulb`, etc.) |
| `theme_style.yaml` | LVGL-wide defaults, `page_style`, dark/light theme switcher |
| `theme_style_debug.yaml` | Same as above with red outlines for layout debugging |
| `backlight_time.yaml` | 3-mode brightness (Day/Evening/Night) based on sun position |
| `wifi.yaml` | WiFi configuration template |
| `ota.yaml` | Full-screen OTA overlay with progress bar |
| `time_homeassistant.yaml` | Time sync from Home Assistant |
| `time_sntp.yaml` | Time sync via NTP (standalone, no HA) — do not combine with `backlight_time.yaml` |

### Theme and Color Rules

Always reference colors by name — never by hex value. Two pools are available:

- **Library colors** defined in `common/color.yaml`: `ep_orange`, `steel_blue`, `misty_blue`, `very_dark_gray`, `ep_green`, `ep_blue`, and many more
- **ESPHome built-in CSS colors**: `aliceblue`, `coral`, `dodgerblue`, `forestgreen`, `teal`, etc.

Button appearance is controlled via substitution variables in the user's device YAML:

```yaml
substitutions:
  button_on_color:  "ep_orange"
  button_off_color: "very_dark_gray"
  icon_on_color:    "yellow"
  icon_off_color:   "gray"
  label_on_color:   "white"
  label_off_color:  "gray"
  icon_font:        mdi_icons_40
```

Component files always use these substitution vars — never hardcoded colors or font IDs.

### Hardware (`hardware/`)

Each file is a self-contained device config providing display driver, touch controller, backlight PWM, I2C bus, PSRAM, and framework settings. Included as a single package. Provides `$screen_width` and `$screen_height` substitutions used by OTA and other components.

Supported families: Guition, Sunton, Waveshare, Elecrow, LilyGo, Espressif dev kits, and SDL desktop simulation.

### Sensors (`sensors/`)

- `sensors_base.yaml` — WiFi signal, CPU temp, device info, restart/factory-reset buttons, LVGL label updates
- `sensors_base-SDL.yaml` — Minimal version for SDL desktop testing

### Widgets (`widgets/`)

- `swipe_navigation.yaml` — Adds swipe gestures to any page via YAML anchor merge (`<<: !include`)

### Upstream Feature Modules

The following modules exist in the repository and are fully functional but are upstream features not maintained by this fork. Refer to the upstream README for documentation:

- `weather_homeassistant/` — 4-day weather forecast via `weather.get_forecasts`
- `tides/` — NOAA tide data with gauge and high/low tide times
- `solar/` — Enphase Envoy production/consumption monitoring
- `custom_components/noaa_tides/` — Custom ESPHome component backing the tides module

## Icon System

Icons use Material Design Icons via substitution variables from `common/mdi_glyph_substitutions.yaml`. Usage: `icon: $mdi_lightbulb`. The actual font must be declared in the device YAML with the specific glyphs needed:

```yaml
font:
  - file: 'https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Webfont/raw/v7.4.47/fonts/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf'
    id: mdi_icons_40
    size: 40
    bpp: 8
    glyphs: [$mdi_lightbulb, $mdi_ceiling_light, ...]
```

---

## Testing

```bash
cd /path/to/parent/directory
bash esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/testing/test_configs.sh
```

Runs `esphome config` on every file in `example_code/` to verify YAML compilation. Run this before committing any change.

---

## SDL Desktop Development

Use the SDL hardware config to develop and test UI on a desktop (Linux/macOS) without flashing hardware:

```yaml
packages:
  hardware: !include esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/hardware/SDL-lvgl.yaml
  sensors:  !include esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons/sensors/sensors_base-SDL.yaml
```

Then run `esphome run <your-config>.yaml`. A window opens simulating the touchscreen. This is the recommended first step before deploying to real hardware.
